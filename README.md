# SPAM-MAIL-DETECTION
This python program uses classification technique to classify the spam mail and the ham mail...
we also use a spamham.csv file in this program..



SVM algorithm to large extent utilized for email classification. It is easy to implement with the more accurate outcomes. Support vector requires an input data set and produce the prediction output which can be further used to distinguish the data into two separate classes. A SVM does sorting of mails by building a hyper plane which should have N-dimension that sorts the data into two parts and SVM is mostly applied for sorting and association. Two hyper planes are built in order to characterize the mails
